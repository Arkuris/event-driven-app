# event-driven-app
- CAPS Phase 1: Begin the build of an application for a product called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, we’ll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, each vendor will be notified that their customers received what they purchased.

- This will be an event driven application that “distributes” the responsibility for logging to separate modules, using only events to trigger logging based on activity.

# LAB 12: Socket.io
- In Phase 2, we’ll be changing the underlying networking implementation of our CAPS system from using node events to using a library called Socket.io so that clients can communicate over a network. Socket.io manages the connection pool for us, making broadcasting much easier to operate, and works well both on the terminal (between servers) and with web clients.

# LAB 13:
- In Phase 3, we are building a set of features to help manage deliveries made by CAPS Drivers. This will simulate a delivery driver receiving a list of orders from a Queue and “scanning” package codes on delivery. Retailers will be able to see in their dashboard or log, a list of all packages delivered in real time. Should a delivery driver deliver any packages while the retailer is not connected to the dashboard, the vendor client should be guaranteed to receive “delivery” notifications from the Queue system.
